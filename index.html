  <h3>Scott Woodlee</h3>
  <div class="team-title">Principal Partner & Senior Investigator</div>

  <p>
    Scott Woodlee is the founder and Senior Investigator of Forensic Integrity Group (FIG),
    a specialized firm focused on the review, analysis, and defense-oriented evaluation of
    wiretap and electronic surveillance evidence for legal and investigative purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    With over 15 years of law enforcement experience, including eight years conducting
    narcotics wiretap investigations, Scott has participated in more than 30 state and
    federal wiretap cases. His work has earned a reputation for precision, discretion, and
    investigative insight. Notably, he conducted the first heroin wiretap investigation in
    Central Florida, establishing an operational and legal benchmark for subsequent cases.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to his domestic law enforcement career, Scott served 20 years as a U.S. Army
    paratrooper specializing in strategic, tactical, and special operations intelligence.
    His assignments included lawful interception, communications intelligence exploitation,
    and analytical support to tactical operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    During overseas deployments, Scott supported foreign partner law enforcement units in
    Latin America, including Peru and Colombia, where wiretap and communications analysis
    were critical to counter-narcotics and organized crime investigations. These assignments
    occurred during the Colombian government’s efforts to dismantle cartel leadership and
    transnational criminal networks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scott later provided intelligence and wiretap-related analytical support to Tactical
    Analysis Team (TAT) operations in Barranquilla, Colombia, including Army Airborne
    Reconnaissance Low (ARL) missions staged out of Panama. He was also deployed in support
    of Operation Restore Democracy in Haiti, assisting in the exploitation and dissemination
    of real-time signals intelligence in stability and restoration operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, Scott is a recognized subject matter expert in wiretap and electronic surveillance
    analysis for criminal defense. He routinely evaluates Title III and state intercepts,
    identifying statutory, constitutional, and procedural defects related to necessity,
    minimization, technical integrity, sealing, reporting, and chain of custody. He also
    trains attorneys and investigators on effective wiretap challenges and suppression
    strategies.
